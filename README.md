This is a quick Recipe website using what I learned from The Odin Projects Fundementals course. 

I set up 3 recipes and links to all of them off the homepage.

I used Paragrahs, Headings, Images, Ordered list and Unordered list.

There is an html file for each included recipe.

The recipes are from https://www.allrecipes.com/
